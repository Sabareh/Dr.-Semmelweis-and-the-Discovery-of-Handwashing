# Dr.Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
Reanalyzed the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing. In 1847, the Hungarian physician ***Ignaz Semmelweis*** makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. In this Python project, I reanalyzed the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project was done as part of the DataCamp Data Science with Python Career Track.
